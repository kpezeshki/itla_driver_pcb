Board is generally functional but improvements are possible:

1. The hole size for the meanwell power supply modules is too small, so the modules need to be hacked to fit.

2. The UART module is too far from the board edge. Need to check footprint and shift closer.


Use a 40 mm half-height fan to cool the ITLA.
